-- An alternative "stateless" Ziria semantics
--
-- The main idea is to make a distinction, on the one hand, between
-- (a) the graph of a Ziria computation, which is just a static
-- description of the program's dataflow, together with some
-- control-flow constraints, and (b) the execution model, which is a
-- particular (dynamic) scheduling strategy for executing the nodes of
-- (a).
-- 
-- Below is a draft implementation of (a) in which all nodes in the
-- dataflow graph run concurrently. I think it's possible to view the
-- previous tick-process execution model as a particular dynamic
-- scheduling policy applied to this "soup-of-nodes".  Note that,
-- while I use the term "dataflow graph", there is actually some
-- control flow hidden inside the implementation of `zbind', in the
-- form of a set of control-flow constraints: When we `zbind z1 f',
-- 'f' must block on the private control channel between `z1' and
-- itself before proceeding.
--
-- NOTE that the soup-of-nodes model has the same problems (wrt.
-- parallel pipe-in-bind, etc.) as the tick-process model. See the
-- comment near 'test_pipe_in_bind' below for more discussion.  This
-- file might be a good place to explore possible solutions, but I
-- haven't yet done so.

'zbind z1 (\v -> z2)' is modeled as the dataflow graph that looks
like:
              |-------|
         /----|   z1  |----\
        /     |_______|     \
 a ----/          |          \-----> b
       \          | v        / 
        \     |---v---|     /
         \____|   z2  |____/
              |_______|

where 'a' and 'b' are streams of input/output values and 'v' is the
(private) control channel between 'z1' and 'z2'. 'z2' blocks until the
control channel 'v' is nonempty.

-- The following program may produce result '4 5' (though I haven't
-- yet observed it) due to a pipe-bind race condition (I think the
-- same one that makes an appearance in parpipe-in-bind in the
-- tick-process execution model):

-- When (zemit 0) sends () on the private control channel sitting
-- between (zemit 0 `zpipe` zemit 5) and (zemit 4), it does not
-- synchronize with (zemit 5), which therefore continues to execute,
-- possibly writing 5 to the output channel after (zemit 4) has
-- written 4. My feeling is that pipe-in-bind is a general problem,
-- even with the tick-process model, and probably orthogonal to the
-- particular choice of execution model.
--
-- It's possible to prevent the race condition from occurring by
-- introducing extra synchronizations (before (zemit 5) does anything
-- observable, e.g., writing 5 to the output channel, make it check
-- that (zemit 0) hasn't yet signalled). However, the extra
-- synchronizations probably incur a performance pernalty.
--
-- ALSO: none of what's done in this file deals with the related
-- mismatched-inputs problem, in which one component reads more from
-- the input stream than it should have, causing a later-bound
-- component from skipping some of its inputs.
